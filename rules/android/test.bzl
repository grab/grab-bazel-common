    """A macro that executes all android library unit tests.

    Usage:
    The macro creates a single build target to compile all Android unit test classes and then loads
    all Test class onto a test suite for execution.

    The macro adds a mocked Android jar to compile classpath similar to Android Gradle Plugin's
    testOptions.unitTests.returnDefaultValues = true feature.

    The macro assumes Kotlin is used and will use rules_kotlin's kt_jvm_test for execution with
    mocked android.jar on the classpath.

    Executing via Robolectric is currently not supported.

    Args:
        name: name for the test target,
        srcs: the test sources under test.
        src_sets: The root source set path of all test sources
        deps: the build dependencies to use for the generated the android local test target
        and all valid arguments that you want to pass to the android_local_test target
        associates: associates target to allow access to internal members from the main Kotlin target
        resources: A list of files that should be include in a Java jar.
        enable_compose: Enable Jetpack Compose compiler on Kotlin sources
